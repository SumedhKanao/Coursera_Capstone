The Data I will be using will be the location of all the coffee shops in Chicago and the amount of consumers who visit each coffee shop
respectively. As well, I will have Data of the ages of these consumers so the store can generate traffic and attract majority of the 
consumers. By knowing where majority of the coffee shops are, I can see how much revenue is being generated by each store , and to 
determine whether if that location is suitable for a store. As well, I will need to know the data of the median salary as to determine
where the coffee shop will go, as there may be a correlation between higher median salaries and more spending on coffee. All of this data
will be used to factor in to where the potential coffee shop should be placed.
