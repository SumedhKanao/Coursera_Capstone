The problem I will be tackling for my Capstone project is where should a potential new coffee shop set up in  Chicago , so 
that they can maximizie their business and generate the most traffic. My audience that I am targeting are those who are avid coffee lovers,
and potential stakeholders who will be investing in the newly desgined coffee store. This problem is relevant as competition with other 
coffee stores, could put this new store out of business, if the store is not generating enough traffic. By having data that can be analyzed, 
I and the stakeholders can make a valid conclusion about where to place this new store.
